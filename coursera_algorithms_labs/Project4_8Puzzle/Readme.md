The **A\*** (**A-star**) search algorithm is a powerful and widely-used **pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm**, especially known for finding the **shortest path** between two nodes **efficiently**.

---

##  What is A\* used for?

* **Game AI** (e.g., finding a path for a character)
* **GPS navigation systems**
* **Robot motion planning**
* **Network routing**

---

## Key Idea

A\* uses both:

* **Actual cost** from the start (denoted `g(n)`)
* **Estimated cost** to the goal (denoted `h(n)` â€” a heuristic)

It evaluates nodes using:

### `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`

Where:

* `g(n)` is the actual cost from the start to node `n`
* `h(n)` is the **estimated** cost from `n` to the goal (heuristic)
* `f(n)` is the total **estimated cost** of the cheapest path through `n`

---

## How it works (step by step):

1. Start with the initial node.
2. Use a **priority queue (min-heap)** to always explore the node with the **lowest f(n)**.
3. For each neighbor:

    * Calculate `g(n)` and `h(n)`
    * Add/update it in the queue based on `f(n)`
4. Repeat until you reach the goal.

---

## The Heuristic (h(n))

The efficiency of A\* depends heavily on how good `h(n)` is.

**Common heuristics:**

* **Euclidean distance** (straight-line distance in 2D)
* **Manhattan distance** (grid-based paths: |dx| + |dy|)

**Requirement:** Heuristic must be **admissible** (never overestimates the true cost) for A\* to guarantee the shortest path.

---

## Pros

* **Optimal** (if heuristic is admissible)
* **Efficient** (much faster than Dijkstra or BFS in many practical cases)
* Combines best of **Dijkstraâ€™s** (guaranteed shortest path) and **Greedy Best-First Search** (fast but not always optimal)

---

##  Example in a 2D grid (maze)

Imagine a robot needs to move from top-left to bottom-right avoiding walls. A\* explores the grid, expanding promising nodes (based on `f(n)`), until it reaches the goal.

---

##  Pseudocode

```java
openSet = PriorityQueue<Node>
openSet.add(start)

while (!openSet.isEmpty()) {
    Node current = openSet.remove();

    if (current == goal)
        return reconstructPath();

    for (each neighbor of current) {
        tentative_g = current.g + cost(current, neighbor)

        if (tentative_g < neighbor.g) {
            neighbor.g = tentative_g
            neighbor.f = neighbor.g + h(neighbor)
            neighbor.parent = current
            openSet.add(neighbor)
        }
    }
}
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ In short

* A\* is a smart pathfinder.
* It uses both **actual cost so far** and a **guess** of the cost to go.
* With a good heuristic, it's fast and accurate.
