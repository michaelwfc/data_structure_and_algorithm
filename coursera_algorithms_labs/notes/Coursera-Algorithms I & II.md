# Readings. 
Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2011, ISBN 0-321-57351-X.
[Algorithms, 4th edition booksite](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
Our textbook is the basic reference for the material we will be covering. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we will assign suggested (but optional) readings for students who wish more extensive coverage of the material.
Our booksite, which is open to everyone and contains a wealth of supplementary information, including synopses of the textbook and Java code that you will be using throughout the course.


# Description. 
An introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures. Our emphasis is on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.

Part I focuses on elementary data structures, sorting, and searching. Topics include union−find, binary search, stacks, queues, bags, insertion sort, selection sort, shellsort, quicksort, 3-way quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, binary heaps, binary search trees, red−black trees, separate-chaining and linear-probing hash tables, Graham scan, and kd-trees. 

Part II focuses on graph and string-processing algorithms. Topics include depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju−Sharir, Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman−Ford, Ford−Fulkerson, LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries, Knuth−Morris−Pratt, Boyer−Moore, Rabin–Karp, regular expression matching, run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression and Burrows−Wheeler transform. Part II also introduces reductions and intractability, including the P = NP problem.


# Exercises. 
(Sorry, Coursera did not migrate the exercises from the old platform.) There is one exercise set associated with each lecture. An exercise set consists of three drill questions, designed to ensure that you understand the basics. We expect that each exercise set will take approximate 10–30 minutes to complete. You may attempt each exercise set up to 10 times (your best score is recorded); you will receive a different set of questions on each attempt. Solutions are provided after each attempt.

# Programming assignments. 
There is one Java programming assignment per week. Some of the programming assignments require that you implement a data structure or algorithm from scratch; others require that you apply a data structure or algorithm to solve a problem from science, commerce, or recreation. We expect that each programming assignment will take approximately 4–20 hours to complete, depending on your programming experience and how far beyond the basic performance requirements you wish to go. You may attempt each programming assignment up to 10 times (your best score is recorded). After each attempt, we will provide feedback on correctness and efficiency.

# Java. 
The assignments require that you use the Java programming language. More specifically, the autograder uses Java 8 to compile, execute, and test your Java programs. We recommend our custom IntelliJ-based programming environment for 
Mac OS X,  Windows, or Linux, but you are free to use any IDE. More details about the autograder are available in the Assessment Guide.

Final exam. (Sorry, Coursera did not migrate the final exam from the old platform.) The final exam is cumulative and designed to make sure you understand how each algorithm works and when it is effective. The final does not involve Java programming. Many of the questions will be based on questions from the exercises and in-lecture quizzes. You may attempt the final exam up to 3 times (your best score is recorded).

Job interview questions. Each week, we will also provide a few algorithmic job interview questions based on the material for the week, inspired by questions asked at leading technology companies. The questions are for self-enrichment and are not assessed; however, we will provide some hints and you are welcome to discuss solutions in the discussion forums with your classmates.
